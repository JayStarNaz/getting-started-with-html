 <p> <h1>Udacity Beginner's notes</h1></p>
   <body> <p>Remember first year of college, when you built that Buffy fan site out of HTML, but then quit because tables were such a pain? We're digging into that old rusty skill set again.</p>
  <strong>Basic Internet Structure</strong> <p>At the most basic level, the Internet runs in ways that I already understand, but this is a nice refresher.</p>
  <p><strong>Computers are Literal</strong></p><p>And not in the figurative sense of the word. Rather like men. </p><strong> Remember the HTML Basics:</strong>
  <p>Opening and closing tags: "<" and ">" on either side of whatever you're writing.</p> If you drop one of those brackets, or 
  forget to close a tag, then the world ends and your code breaks (or you<i> just get</i> inappropriately italicized words and 
  whatnot) Also: nota bene: "i" is no longer italics. Use "em" instead.</p><p>Remember photobucket, and all the times you messed up
  linking the PERFECT image in a Livejournal account? Yep. URL and image tags. I wonder if I can remember how to combine the two. 
  Let's see...<a href="www.tthfanfic.org"><img src="http://static.tthf.me/images/titles/Landmarks.png" alt="Twisting The Hellmouth header" /></a></p><p>Muwah!...No one tell TTH that I used their header for a class assignment.</p>
  <strong>Inline vs Block</strong><p>This sounds alomost like a boxing announcement, doesn't it? Anyway, these tags we've talked 
  about - they come in different flavors. Some tags work inline with the text, such as the <b>bold</b> tags.
  The span tag is also inline. Seeing it rendered makes it pretty obvious.The block tags, however, make, well,<div>blocks.</div><p>Again, seeing it render makes it pretty obvious</p>
